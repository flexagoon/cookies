A collection of personal project templates.

The templates can be used with [this fish script](https://github.com/flexagoon/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_config/fish/functions/new.fish).

The goal of those templates is to enforce the strictest possible linting,
formatting and type checking for all languages to write high-quality code.

## Template list

- [python-app](https://github.com/flexagoon/cookies/tree/main/python-app)

  A python application with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package
  management, [ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) for linting and
  [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking.

- [go](https://github.com/flexagoon/cookies/tree/main/go)

  A generic go project with [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/) for linting.
